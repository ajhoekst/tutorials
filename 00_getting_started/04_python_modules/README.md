# Purpose
Ok, our code is getting sufficiently complicated. Let's be just a little proactive and re-organize it into a python module so we can easily add more code! Organizing our code this way enables us to make it into a package that can be imported into other code.

# To Run
```
>> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
>> python3 -m cli hello
Hello, World!
>> python3 -m cli fetch
