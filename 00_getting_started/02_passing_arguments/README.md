# Purpose
Programs are boring when they only do one thing. Let's add the ability to change the program's behavior with program arguments! Note: we've changed the output to print the HTTP response headers so we know the program is running differently.

# To Run
```
>> pip3 install click
>> python3 passing_arguments.py https://www.twitter.com/
